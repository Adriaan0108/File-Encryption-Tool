Cryptography is the study of securing communication. Encryption is the method used
to conceal messages using algorithms. The main objective of cryptography is to
protect the confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation of
information.

This tool uses Advance Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt files.
Advance Encryption Standard (AES), also known as the Rijndael algorithm, is an
encrypting algorithm developed in 1998 by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen 
and recommended by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) to replace Data Encryption Standard (DES) in 2001.

Advantages of AES:
* Uses the least amount of time to encrypt and decrypt bigger files.
* Uses less memory than most of the other algorithms.
* Exhibits the highest Avalanche effect which means it leads to high diffusion in
information.
* Scores a high average entropy per byte of encryption.
